【一级标题】Risks Without Hong Kong Entity
【二级标题】Market Access and Credibility Challenges
Brazilian companies operating directly in Asia face [significant credibility barriers] without Hong Kong presence. Many Chinese and Asian partners prefer dealing with Hong Kong-registered entities due to established legal frameworks and familiar business practices.
