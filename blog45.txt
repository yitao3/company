【一级标题】Risks Without Hong Kong Entity
【二级标题】Market Access and Credibility Challenges
Canadian companies operating directly in mainland China face [significant credibility barriers] without Hong Kong presence. Many Chinese partners prefer dealing with Hong Kong-registered entities due to established legal frameworks, cultural familiarity, and geographic proximity.

Operating solely through Canadian entities creates [complex compliance burdens] when targeting Asian markets. Without Hong Kong's streamlined regulatory framework for regional operations, Canadian companies face redundant reporting requirements and operational inefficiencies.
